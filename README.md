Running through GitHub's Tutorial.

Greetings!

I go by Cloud4skies. I mostly work with C, but I am familiar with C++ and Java.
I'm self taught, and enjoy takling concepts that are unfamiliar.
There's that peculiar "high" you get when you produce working code.

Aside from that, I enjoy reading books and playing Video Games.
Currently, Dark Souls (all of them) and Monster Hunter (again, all of them)
are my current fun times.

I'll leave it there for now. See you all around!
